================================= NPM EXERCISE UPDATES

  1. Install the following dependencies with npm:

    @babel/core
    @babel/preset-env
    babel-loader
    webpack
    webpack-cli

  2. Use this module in the Webpack config file instead of the version from the curriculum:

    module: {
      rules: [
        {
          test: /\.m?js$/,
          exclude: /(node_modules|bower_components)/,
          use: {
            loader: 'babel-loader',
            options: {
              presets: ['@babel/preset-env']
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }


  3. Instead of "webpack" for the value of "build" in the scipts file, use 
  "webpack --mode=development"



CONFIG FILE HAS TO BE CALLED
